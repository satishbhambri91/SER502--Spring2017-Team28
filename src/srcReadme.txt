Instructions to build and run your language:
Welcome to Nihao language. Kindly follow the steps below to run the programs in our compiler:
1. Download the ".jar" file of our project.
2. Download one of the sample input program from the data directory of our Github link, and save it in the local computer.
3. In the commandline(preferably Mac or UNIX terminal), run the command "java -jar Nihao.jar <sample_program_file-name>".
4. It will give you the output as the Intermediate code and the parse tree.The intermediate code is copied into file "ni.ic".
5. Now, extract the Nihao.jar, and go to the directory where we have the Runtime.py file.
6. Run the command "python2.7 Runtime.py ni.ic" and we will get the output of the program.

Sample Programs to be run from Data directories are:

1.add_subtract_sample.ni
2.bool_check.ni
3.if_else_sample.ni
4.more_if_else_sample.ni
